### Sequence Alignment
- Sequence alignment is the process of comparing two or more sequences of nucleotides or amino acids to identify regions of similarity and difference. It is an important tool in bioinformatics and is used to compare DNA or protein sequences to identify evolutionary relationships, functional domains, mutations, and other features. There are two main types of sequence alignment:
- In global alignment, the entire length of both sequences is aligned from the beginning to the end, whereas in local alignment, only the most similar regions of the sequences are aligned.

#### Local Alignment
#### Global Alignment
- Needleman-Wunsch Algorithm: Dynamic programming algorithm used to find the optimal alignment of two sequences
- Gobalxx Algorithm
- Dot-Matrix
- K-Tuple Method: Heuristic approach to sequence alignment, which means it provides an approximate solution that is faster than exact algorithms like Needleman-Wunsch or Smith-Waterman.
  
#### Clustring
- Clustering is a technique used to group similar objects or data points together based on their similarity. In bioinformatics, clustering is often used to group genes or proteins based on their expression profiles, sequence similarity, or other features. Clustering algorithms commonly used in bioinformatics include hierarchical clustering, K-means clustering, and self-organizing maps.
  
#### Classification
- Classification is a technique used to assign objects or data points to predefined categories or classes. In bioinformatics, classification is often used to predict the function of genes or proteins based on their sequence or expression data. Classification algorithms commonly used in bioinformatics include decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks.
  
#### Regression
- Regression is a technique used to predict a continuous variable based on one or more input variables. In bioinformatics, regression is often used to predict gene expression levels or protein interactions based on sequence or other features. Regression algorithms commonly used in bioinformatics include linear regression, logistic regression, and ridge regression.
